## Authorization vs Authentication
- Authentication and authorization are two important concepts in the field of computer security. Although these terms are often used interchangeably, they refer to distinct and separate processes.

## Authentication
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In other words, it is the process of ensuring that the user is who they claim to be. Authentication is typically performed by presenting some form of identification, such as a username and password, a digital certificate, a smart card, or a biometric measure.

For example, when you log in to your email account, you enter your username and password to authenticate yourself. The email server then checks that your username and password match what is stored in its database. If the authentication is successful, you are granted access to your email.

## Authorization
- Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system is allowed to perform a particular action or access a particular resource. In other words, it is the process of ensuring that the user has the appropriate level of permissions to perform a certain action.

For example, once you are authenticated and logged in to your email account, you may only have access to certain folders or be able to perform certain actions such as send and receive emails. This is determined by the authorization settings, which specify what a user is allowed to do and what they are not allowed to do.

## Example
- Consider a bank that has a web application that allows users to view their account information and make transactions. When a user logs in to the web application, they are authenticated by entering their username and password.

- Once the user is authenticated, the web application checks their authorization level to determine what actions they are allowed to perform. For example, the user may only be authorized to view their account balance and transaction history, but not authorized to transfer funds or access other users' account information.

In this example, authentication is the process of verifying the user's identity through their username and password, while authorization is the process of determining what actions they are allowed to perform based on their user role and permission settings.

## Conclusion
- In summary, authentication and authorization are both important concepts in computer security, and they are often used together to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive information. Understanding the difference between these two concepts is crucial in designing and implementing secure systems.
